# MathExpressionEvaluator
This Java project evaluates math expressions from text file input and display output of the evaluated math expression. Stack ,Linked Lists and Dynamic Arrays have been implemented. It breaks an expression from the text file into tokens(parsing). Convert expression to postfix from infix using stack to maintain the order of precedence.The math operations supported are +,-,*,/ . open and close paranthesis are accepted () and have higher precedence. I have implemented stacks using linked list and dynamic arrays. You can analyze the performance for dynamic array and linked list implementation of stack
